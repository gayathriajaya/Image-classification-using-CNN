Fruit and vegetable image classification using CNN

This project aims to create a Convolutional Neural Network model that would recognise various items from the fruits and vegetable section in a 
supermarket store from the image of the item taken as input. The model's performance is subsequently measured against a pre- trained library like 
MobileNet-v2. The project proceeds to compare the time taken by a person to manually select an item in a self-checkout till in a supermarket 
against the time this model takes to predict the item from its image.
